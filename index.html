        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I’m Gennilo Dave G. Pasanting, 16 years old, born on November 3, 2008. I’m into volleyball, gaming, and
            pretty much anything that keeps me physically active. I also enjoy drawing, playing the guitar, and
            singing—even if I’m not that great at it, I still have fun doing it. I used to be really into coding,
            especially back in Grade 11 when it first caught my interest, but now that I’m in Grade 12, the passion’s
            faded a bit. Still, I like to explore different things and just go with whatever keeps life interesting.</p>

            <h3>PDF Generator</h3>
            <p>This project is a clean, functional web application that generates well-formatted PDF reports based on user input.

It features an intuitive UI, supports custom text content, and is ideal for creating product summaries, research reports, or documentation. The system is extendable for database integration and is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and TCPDF.</p>
